Advice for taking ARVs
Time management
Late

P: What if I forget to take a dose?
Normal answer → M: Take the dose you missed as soon as possible and then continue with your regular schedule. However, if it is nearly time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose and just take the following one at the usual time. Do not double up doses.

Specific cases → M: For which medication?
P: meds_name
IF Sustiva → 
M: Take your missed dose of Sustiva as soon as possible .. and then continue with your regular schedule tomorrow.
IF Other meds → 
M: How long have you missed your dose, in hours?

P: time in hrs
IF>20 hrs → 
M: It is nearly time for your next dose, do not take the missed dose and just take the following one at the usual time.
IF >1hr and <= 20hrs → 
M: Take the dose you missed as soon as possible and then continue with your regular schedule. 
IF <= 1hr →
M: Then you don’t need to worry about it. It is sometimes difficult to take your meds at the exact same time every day. There is a window of about an hour on either side of your target time when it is still fine to take them. For example, if you want to take your meds every night at 10 pm, then any time between 9pm and 11pm will be fine.

M: Did this situation happen a lot in the last few weeks?
P: Yes, no, always, never, etc…
	IF yes, always, sometimes, often → Marvin saves answer as it if for I-Score 6-1
→ M: It seems that you may have some difficulty taking your medications due to your daily life activities.I would suggest that you pick an easier time of day and take your medication at that time every day.
	IF no, never → Marvin saves answer as it if for I-Score 6-1
		→ M: Great!

M: By the way, do you have an undetectable viral load?
P: U or D or refuse/don’t know
IF U → 
M: There is more flexibility once you have been undetectable for some time. One late dose shouldn’t be a problem.
IF D → 
M: It is important to take your meds regularly, at the same time each day, and to keep to this schedule as closely as possible.
IF refuse/don’t know 🡪 
M: Since you don’t have an answer for this question. Here is the information that I can give you!
M: If your viral load is detectable, it is important to take your meds regularly, at the same time each day, and to keep to this schedule as closely as possible.
M: If your viral load is undetectable, there is more flexibility once you have been undetectable for some time. One late dose shouldn’t be a problem.
M: Also, do you know what U=U means?
P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: Perfect! U=U is a very important goal to achieve and only 50% of HIV patients know what it means.
M: If you ever forget or want to know more about U=U, let me know!
IF N: go to U=U

M: You can also ask me to help you set a reminder for taking your medications by saying” add a reminder”. 
	
Early

P: I was early with my meds, is that OK?
M: How early were you on your next scheduled dose, in hours?
P: time in hrs
IF >25% expected interval (posology 24h*25% = 6 hours) → 
M: Since you are X hours early, simply take your next dose at the usual time.
M: Antiretrovirals are generally very safe. Therefore, taking 2 doses close together should not cause any significant side effects.
M: That said, in general, it is good advice to aim for the same time each day. Getting into a routine or habit will help you remember. However, being early shouldn't cause you any problems.
	IF >1hr and <25% expected interval = 6 hours →
M: Since you are X hours early, you can skip the next scheduled dose. Then resume your regular schedule.
M: That said, in general, it is good advice to aim for the same time each day. Getting into a routine or habit will help you remember. However, being early shouldn't cause you any problems.
	IF <=1hr →
M: Then you don't need to worry about it. It is sometimes difficult to take your meds at the exact same time everyday. There is a window about an hour either side of your target time when it is still fine to take them. For example, if you want to take your meds every night at 10 pm, then any time between 9pm and 11pm will be fine.

M: Also, do you know what U=U means?
P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: Perfect! U=U is a very important goal to achieve and only 50% of HIV patients know what it means.

		→ M: Great!

M: To help you with your medication schedule, you could set a reminder by saying "set a reminder".


Window

P: Do I have to take your meds at exactly the same time each day?
M: It is sometimes difficult to take your meds at the same time every day. Even when starting a treatment, there is a window of about an hour either side of your target time where it is still fine to take your medication. For example, if you want to take your meds every night at 10 p.m., then any time between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. will be fine.
M: Did you exceed that lapse on your last dose?
P: Y or N
If Y →

M: If you ever forget or want to know more about U=U, let me know!
IF N: go to U=U

Time switch

P: Can I change the time when I take my meds?
M: It is fine to change the time you take your medication, as long as the new time for your meds is one that you can follow in the future. However, you should avoid changing time often, for instance every weekend.
M: Let me ask a bit more about that.
M: How frequently does an irregular or unpredictable schedule make taking your HIV medication difficult?
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
	IF yes, always, sometimes, often → Marvin saves answer as it if for I-Score 20-7

M: That’s good. So in this case, if you have some medication, the best thing to do is to restart taking your meds now. Meanwhile, it will be better for you to book an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible and to let them know that you have missed your dose several times. They may check your viral load and give you advice on taking your medication regularly.

 Best time

P: When is the best time to take my medication?
M: What is your medication?
P: meds_name
	IF Atripla or Sustiva
M: meds_name should be taken before bed time. 
M: If you experience nightmares, a hangover effect or have difficulty sleeping as a side effect, take during supper time with a low-fat meal. 
	IF Rilpivirine
M: Rilpivirine should be taken with a caloric meal (about 533 calories). Taking rilpivirine with a high protein nutritional drink (Boost, Ensure, etc.) does not replace a meal and is not sufficient to promote the absorption of rilpivirine.
M: Lunch or dinner are good times to take your medication. Breakfast is also an option if you eat it daily and with the necessary amount of calories. 
M: You also should keep the meal time at which you take your medication as consistent as possible, but you do have a 2 hours window to take your rilpivirine everyday. 

	ELSE check meds_frequency and meds_meal

IF meds_frequency = 1/day and meds_meal = with or without food
M: Meds_name can be taken at any time of day, but should be taken at the same time every day. 
M: It is very important to find a time that you can stick to every day and that you will not miss. 

IF meds_frequency = 1/day and meds_meal = with food
M: Meds_name should be taken with a meal.
M: Lunch or dinner are good times to take your medication. Breakfast is also an option if you eat it daily.
M: You also should keep the meal time at which you take your medication as consistent as possible, but you do have a 2 hours window to take your meds_name everyday. 

IF meds_frequency = 2/day and meds_meal = with or without food
M: Meds_name should be taken twice a day, with a 12h interval in between, for example at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
M: Taking your medication in the morning and then in the evening is the most common schedule. You should pick a time that you can stick to everyday and that works with your sleep schedule. 
M: You do have a 2 hours window to take your meds_name everyday. 

IF meds_frequency = 2/day and meds_meal = with food
M: Meds_name should be taken twice a day, with a 12h interval in between and each dose with a meal 
M: This means the best times are during breakfast and dinner if they are 12h apart. If not, you can replace a meal with a big snack to ensure the 12h interval. 
M: You do have a 2 hours window to take your meds_name everyday. 

M: If you ever miss a dose or you are early/late on your medication, let me know! I can help you with that. 
M: If you want, you can also ask me to help you set a reminder for taking your medications by saying "add a reminder".

Tips for medication adherence

P: Do you have any advice on medication adherence? Do you have tips to not forget to take your medication? 
M: 1. Be familiar with your prescription (when to take your medication, with or without a meal). Your doctor or pharmacist can give you this information or you can ask me specific questions and I will try my best to help you. 
M: 2. If you have many pills to take each day, use a pill box to organize your pills by day which makes it easier to make sure you have taken your medication on a given day. Place the pill box in a convenient and safe place that will help you remember to take it at the same time each day.
M: 3. Make sure to refill your prescription before you do not have any more medication. Most prescriptions can be refilled within the last week before the due date. Set up a reminder on your phone or use a preauthorized prescription refill service if it is offered by your pharmacy. 
M: 4. Ask me to set up a reminder alert for taking your medication in your phone. You can do that by saying ”add a reminder”.
	M: Would you like more tips?
P: Y or N
	IF Y: 
M: 5. Keep some medication in your bag or at the office in the event you are not home when you need to take your treatment. Make sure to check if there are any specific storage instructions for your medication in addition to keeping your medication in a secure container and out of sight and reach of children.
M: 6. If you think about travelling, plan ahead. I have travel tips I can share with you if you are interested. 
M: 7. Attend your follow-up medical appointments and discuss your treatment with your health care team as needed. 
M: Here is an infographic that presents all of the previous tips: https://i.imgur.com/suGdXEk.jpg

IF N:

Identification with pill name

P: I don’t know which one is Atripla.
	Marvin sends Photo_Atripla
	M: It looks like this. To help you, the Atripla pill is pink. It has the numbers and letters "123" written on it. 
M: Do you have this type of pill?
P: Yes. Thank you

Storage

P: How should I store my medication? 
	M: What meds?
P: Atripla
M: You should keep your Atripla, in a dry place between 15-30°C. Avoid exposure to heat, humidity or direct sunlight. Avoid areas such as bathrooms, near windows or near any  hot appliances. Please don't forget to keep your medication in a secure container and out of sight and reach of children.

Crush, cut, split

P: Can I cut my medication?
	M: What meds?
P: Meds_name
	Marvin checks if it’s tablet or capsule
	IF tablet → Marvin checks Meds_crush
IF Meds_crush = Y → 
M: Meds_name can be split or crushed and added to a small amount of semi-solid food or liquid and taken immediately. Make sure to take all the pill fragments to get the proper dose and maintain your treatment’s efficacy.
IF Meds_crush = N → 
M: Meds_name should not be chewed, crushed or split. You need to swallow the whole pill at once with water.
	IF capsule → Marvin checks Meds_crush
IF Meds_crush = Y → 
M: Meds_name can be opened and the content can be taken with food or mixed with a glass of water. Make sure to take all the capsule content to get the proper dose and maintain your treatment’s efficacy.
IF Meds_crush = N → 
M: Meds_name should not be opened. You need to swallow the whole capsule at once with water.

M: By the way, do you have any difficulty swallowing your medication? For example, because of its size, taste… If so, does it always make you feel difficult to take your medication?
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
	IF yes,always, often, sometimes & Meds crush=Y → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 20-14
M: Ok! Then as I suggested, you could split or crush your pills. Liquid will also help you to swallow the pill.
IF yes,always, often, sometimes & Meds_crush=N → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 20-14
M: If you can, continue to take your medication as prescribed. Meanwhile, contact your doctor or your pharmacist as soon as possible. They could help you to see if there are other options for you, such as switching to a liquid version of the medication or a different therapy.
IF no,never → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 20-14
M: Good to know.

Double doses

P: I’ve taken two pills by mistake, am I going to be OK?
M: There is no need to worry, a single doubled dose shouldn’t affect the effectiveness or toxicity of the drug. Continue with your normal doses at the next scheduled time.
M: Most medications are broken down by the body and last between 12 to 24 hours. Even at a doubled dose, the body still metabolizes the drug at a similar rate, which requires you to take the next dose at your regularly scheduled time. 
M: Depending on what medication is taken, there may be an increased risk for side effects. If you suspect that you may be experiencing adverse effects that could be due to your medication, contact your pharmacist.

Normal Quantity

P: How much should I take daily?
    	M: What meds?
P: Meds_name
    	Marvin checks Meds_quantity and Meds_frequency
	M: You should take Meds_quantity pill Meds_frequency (e.g.1 time per day, 2 times per day, etc…)
M: Do you often have difficulty taking your medication because you don't know how much you should take? By difficult, I mean that taking your medication was either skipped, delayed or very unpleasant….
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
	IF yes,always, often, sometimes → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-4
M: A pill box can help you! You can divide the medication you want to take each day in advance by dose and just take it on time….
IF no,never → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-4
		M: Great then! Remember to take your medication on time

Food with meds
Empty stomach?

P: Should I take my meds with or without food?
M: What meds?
P: Meds_name
IF Sustiva or Atripla (meds with Efavirenz) →
M: Meds_name may be taken with or without food. But don’t take a high fat meal which can increase the drug levels of efavirenz up to 60%. This can then increase the side effects. Nearly all other foods are fine, just leave a couple of hours when the meal is high fat.
ELSE check Meds_meal 
	IF Meds_meal = with or without →
		M: Meds_name may be taken with or without food.
IF Meds_meal = with normal caloric meal → 
M: Meds_name should be taken with caloric meal (about 533 calories). Taking meds_name with a high protein nutritional drink (Boost, Ensure, etc.) does not replace a meal and is not sufficient to promote the absorption of meds_name.
M: Do you often have difficulty taking your medication because you don't know how to take it? By difficult, I mean that taking your medication was either skipped, delayed or very unpleasant.
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
IF yes,always, often, sometimes → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-4
M: Ok… In this case, continue to take your medication as prescribed by your doctor. Then when available, contact your doctor or pharmacist. Let them know about these difficulties, such as if you have a preference or concern about food restrictions, so that you can get the most appropriate treatment.
	IF no,never → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-4
M: Great then! Remember to take your medication on time!

Advice for 533 calories food

P: What types of food have the 533 calories needed for my meds?
M: For example, a meal consisting of 250g of lasagna with meat sauce (285 calories), 100g of salad with reduced fat dressing (106 calories) and 1 slice of wholemeal bread with butter (124 calories), would amount to a total of 515 calories. You can consult the following link https://www.calories.info/ to see the caloric contents of various foods!
M: That being said, I have a question.
M: Have you recently skipped and delayed medication because you didn't know what foods to take? Do you find these things make it difficult to take your medication?
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
IF yes,always, often, sometimes → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score  20-12
M: I see, in order to take your medication as prescribed by your doctor, you can take it at lunch or dinner. Breakfast is also an option if you eat it daily and with the necessary amount of calories. 
M: If you still have difficulties taking your medication because of the food constraint, do not hesitate to discuss it with your doctor or pharmacist the next time you see them.
	IF no,never → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 20-12
M: Great then! Remember to take your medication on time!


Softdrink

P: Can I drink cola or other soda?
M: Drinking cola will not affect your medication, your CD4 or viral load. It does contain a lot of sugar though: One can of soda contains up to 40g of sugar which is equivalent to 10 teaspoons of sugar. So it is not a good drink for your general health, especially if you drink too much cola :)

Alcohol

P: Can I drink alcohol with Atripla?
M: An occasional drink is probably fine. However, avoid excessive or regular consumption of alcohol (beer, wine or hard liquor), Drinking too much alcohol can weaken your immune system which will make it difficult for your body to fight off infections, can increase the risk of liver inflammation and can have serious side effects when combined with some HIV medications.
M: Are you always skipping and delaying your medication because of drinking lately? Do you feel that drinking alcohol often makes it difficult for you to take your medication?
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 20-8
M: Okay, okay, got it. My advice to you is to make sure you prioritize your medication to ensure treatment. Don't skip a dose of medication because you want to drink. Do not miss a dose of your medication because you want to have an alcoholic drink. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, reasonable (social) consumption will limit the long-term health risks.
To give you an idea, a reasonable consumption is a maximum of 10 drinks per week for women and maximum of 15 drinks per week for men.

Supplements

P: Which supplement should I avoid?
M: The majority of natural health products are safe to use but these are to be avoided at all time: Echinacea supplements, taking more than a 1000mg of Vitamin C each day, St John’s wort supplement and garlic capsules.
M: What medication are you on?
P: meds_name
IF Isentress, Isentress HD, Genvoya, Stribild, Tivicay, Triumeq, Dovato, Juluca, Bictarvy, Vocabria
M: Avoid taking iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc and multivitamins at the same time as meds_name. Take them at least 2 hours after taking meds_name.
M: These products interfere with the drug absorption which causes a variation in the drug concentration in your body and therefore may compromise the efficacy and the safety of your HIV treatment.
	ELSE:
		M: Great! No other specific natural health products have to be avoided with meds_name.


New  version: 

P: Which supplement should I avoid? 
 
M: Most supplements have not been specifically studied in combination with HIV medication. This means that we do not know if and how they affect your medication. 
M: Nutritional supplements such as vitamins and minerals, for as long as they respect the recommended maximal intake limit, are not suspected to affect your HIV medications.
M: Supplements containing botanicals, enzymes, or other ingredients that are not usually found in a regular diet are better to be avoided.
M: Taking more than 1000mg of Vitamin C each day, or taking St John’s wort supplement or garlic capsules are proven to alter many HIV medication’s efficacy and safety and are to be avoided at all times.
M: What medication are you on?
P: meds_name
IF Isentress, Isentress HD, Genvoya, Stribild, Tivicay, Triumeq, Dovato, Juluca, Bictarvy, Vocabria
M: Avoid taking iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and multivitamins at the same time as meds_name. Take them at least 2 hours after taking meds_name.
M: These products interfere with the drug absorption which causes a variation in the drug concentration in your body and therefore may compromise the efficacy of your HIV treatment.
ELSE:
M: There are no extra specific precautions that I know of for meds_name. If you are still unsure, it’s probably better to check with your pharmacist.


Food to avoid
 
New version: 

P: What food should I avoid?
M: There is no particular food that you need to avoid while being on treatment with HIV medication.
M: Try to eat as healthy as possible to be able to fight HIV and other infections. Adopt a diet low in fat, low in sugar, high in fruits and vegetables.To learn more about what makes a healthy diet, the Canadian Food Guide is a good source of information.
M : If your CD4 count falls below 100 cells/microL, you are at higher risk of getting infected from contaminated food with a parasite called toxoplasmosis. Try to handle food as safely as possible to protect yourself. Do you want to view some food safety rules/tips?
 
P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: Wash fruits and vegetables well, avoid eating raw or undercooked eggs and meats. Cook food thoroughly, clean utensils and surfaces after each use, wash hands after contact with raw meats or after gardening or contact with soil.
M: When traveling, drink only bottled water If sanitation is questionable/poor.
              	
IF N:
              	M: Let me know if you have other questions!

Stop treatment
P: I don’t want to take meds anymore! / can i stop my treatment?
M: Don’t stop your treatment! HIV treatment is an ongoing, lifelong necessity. This is because HIV can stay inside infected cells of the body for a very long time and the whole process of HIV replication speeds up once treatment is stopped. Your viral load will go up. If you stop and restart your treatment often, the HIV in your body will become resistant and the medication will no longer work even when you do take it.
M: I have a questionnaire here for you. This questionnaire will help me better understand the difficulties you are experiencing so that I can better help you in the future. You need 2 minutes to complete it. Do you want to do it?
P: Y or N
If Y → Trigger scenario I-Score
If N → Flag patients for time-based questions
M: No worries! If for some reason you still need to stop treatment for a limited period, contact your doctor and he can advise you on how to do this so that drug resistance does not develop.
 Changing treatment
P: Can I change my HIV treatment?

M: You should talk with your health care provider if you are thinking about changing HIV medication as they will be able to explore the different options with you and discuss the best course of action for you. 
M: Importantly, you should not stop taking your treatment before consulting your doctor as this could affect your HIV management and promote the development of drug resistance. 



Why should I take my meds every day?

P: Why should I take my meds every day?
M: Taking your HIV medication daily as prescribed allows the HIV medication to reduce the amount of HIV in your body (also called the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral suppression. If the viral load is so low that it doesn’t show up in a standard lab test, this is called having an undetectable viral load. Getting and keeping an undetectable viral load is the best thing you can do to stay healthy.
M: It can also help protect your partners. If you take HIV medication every day, exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load, you have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex. This is called treatment as prevention. 
M: And taking medication regularly is also important because skipping doses makes it easier for HIV to change form, causing your medication to stop working. This is called drug resistance. HIV can become resistant to your medication and to similar medications that you have not yet taken. This limits your options for successful HIV treatment. Drug-resistant strains of HIV can be transmitted to others, too.
M: Have you been feeling unmotivated to take your medication? Or do you sometimes have emotions or thoughts that cause you to not want to take your medication every day?
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
If yes, always, sometimes, often → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-2
M: If you are having trouble taking your drugs as prescribed, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Maybe you’re feeling down and depressed, maybe your life isn’t so stable these days. But you are not the only one. Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist and to people at your local HIV organization to figure out how they can support you. 
M: Adherence can be challenging! Missing an occasional dose is not the end of the world, so don’t panic. Do the best you can to get back on track: You’ll keep your drug combination working for as long as possible and do yourself the most good in the long run.
If no, never → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-2
M: Ok good to know that! Remember to keep a good adherence!

M: Also, do you know what U=U means?
P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: Perfect! U=U is a very important goal to achieve and only 50% of HIV patients know what it means.
M: If you ever forget or want to know more about U=U, let me know!
IF N: go to U=U

Vomiting- a single dose
P: Should I retake my medication after vomiting?
Should I retake my medication after I throw up?
Do tablets still work after throwing up?
What should I do if I throw up shortly after taking a pill?
I took my HIV meds and I vomited within the hour
If I get sick and vomit after I take a pill, should I take another one when I am better?
What should I do if I vomit after taking a pill?
 
 
M: Was this a single episode of vomiting?
P:
if NO: avoid taking another pill for now until vomiting has subsided
if YES: go to the next question
 
M: Is the intact med visible in the vomitus?  Are you able to visualize the pill in the vomit?
P:
If YES: take another pill as soon as you feel comfortable    
if NO: go to the next question
 
M: Did vomiting occur more than 15 minutes, but less than 60 minutes from the time you took the pill?
P:
If NO: if it’s been more than 60 minutes, many health care providers believe that you don’t need to take another dose. Chances are that your pill started to dissolve, and you don’t need to take it again.
If YES: it is better to skip this dose. Missing a single dose won’t affect your HIV treatment safety and efficacy. Doubling the dose on the other hand can increase the risk of side effects.






 Depression 

P: I feel depressed after getting diagnosed with HIV. → “I am feeling (WarningSigns_Parameter)” → M: go to “16.Psychological support V2 according to Dr Brouillette Recommendation”

P: Can you give me more information on how to get other types of support?
M: If you need urgent medical support or in immediate danger, call 9-1-1. 
M: If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call ot text 9-8-8. 
M: If you need other types of help,  check out this link (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/mental-health-services/mental-health-get-help.html#a3)

M: Depression is common among people living with HIV. It can occur either from the HIV itself, or from the medications you take to treat HIV. 

M: Although the diagnosis of HIV can trigger anxiety and distress, this kind of situation-specific emotional response is not the same as depression. A person distressed by an HIV diagnosis may indeed need treatment, most likely for an adjustment reaction, but the distress will respond to supportive and other types of psychotherapy rather than medications. 

The HIV medications that can cause depression includes interleukin, Steroids, Efavirenz(Sustiva), Stavudine(Zerit,d4T),  Zidovudine(Retrovir, AZT), Interferon, Zabine(Hivid), Vinblastine, etc. 

M: Depression limits our quality of life and can often affect our ability to care for our health, making it harder to take our anti - HIV drugs as prescribed and leading to problems with substance use or unsafe sex. 

M: Do you want to know how to cope with it? 


IF Y: 

M: There are several ways to cope with HIV.

Find people to talk to with

Living with HIV can make people feel lonely or isolated. Even though it is difficult to do, you need to find friends, family and community members who can provide support to you. If you have trouble finding people to talk with, then you can use Community health centres, hospitals and clinics, some HIV organizations, telephone or online helplines often offer such services free of charge.

For Quebec Citizens, you can contact ACCM(AIDS Community Care Montreal, 514-527-0928) for help or visit https://accmontreal.org/ for more information.


Eat well, sleep enough and exercise!

Many people with HIV also find that adding vitamin and mineral supplements to their diet helps them to maintain good physical and emotional health. And, as anyone who has ever been sleep-deprived knows, getting a good night’s sleep is also key to our emotional wellness. Exercise can also benefit our emotional health. Doing moderate amounts of exercise on a regular basis is something significant that you can do to build not just your muscles but also your emotional health. Studies show that exercise is effective for treating mild to moderate depression and for reducing anxiety.

Try complementary therapies

You can also try complementary therapies such as acupuncture, light therapy, hypnotherapy and aromatherapy. For example, Aromatherapy blends can consist of “6 drops of lavender essential oil”, “ 4 drops of grapefruit essential oil”, “2 drops of ylang ylang essential oil”. Add these essential oils to 25 ml of grapeseed oil for an uplifting massage or simply add them to your bath. 

※Do not ingest essential oils. Use with caution if you are pregnant or have epilepsy. 

While some complementary therapies are useful, you have to take it very carefully. St.John’s wort is a well known health product, but in the case of HIV patients, it interfere with HIV medications. Another health product named kava kava can cause liver damage. 

You should talk with your doctor and pharmacist about the complementary therapies to know if there are any side effects or drug interactions with your HIV status. 

Seek professional help

A trustworthy and supportive healthcare provider may be able to help you navigate your way back to emotional health when you feel like you have lost your footing. Your doctor may refer you to other emotional health resource people, such as a psychologist, psychotherapist, social worker, or a psychiatrist

Learning how to take care of emotional health is an important part of coping with HIV. If you are feeling depressed, or if you need emotional support, don’t hesitate to ask for help.   

IF N: Ok! If you need any help, let me know!

P: Will I get medications for my depression?
	M: It depends on your psychiatrist. 
	M: You may be given medications, psychotherapy, or both.
P: Which medicine should I take for depression?
M: The same treatments used with depression in the general population are effective in treating depression in HIV+ people. Antidepressants do not cure depression, but they help with symptoms. 

However, antidepressants won't  make you feel better right after you start eating it. It takes at least 4 weeks for the drug to show its effect. So, don’t stop taking drugs even if you think it’s not making you feel better. 

There are four main types of antidepressant drugs : SSRIs(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), Tricyclics, SNRIs(serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors), and MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors). 

SSRI is one of the most used antidepressants for HIV patients, because it has fewer side effects and interactions with HIV drugs. For example, doctor can prescribe sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram for you. 

However, you should speak to your doctor about your medical conditions, and ask the pharmacist for more specific information about the drug interactions. 




Expiration of medication
How to know if expired?

P: How do I know if my medication has expired? The color/aspect of my pills has changed. Should I take them anyway?"
M: Your pills are expired if the expiration date has passed. However, this date may not be valid if your medication was not stored in the conditions recommended by the company. If you notice any appearance or color changes of the pills, this might mean that your medication was not properly stored.
M: Do not use medication if it is not stored properly. Exposure to heat, cold, humidity or direct sunlight can change the molecular form of the active ingredients. This can make the drug less potent.



Expiration date

P: When will my medication expire?
M: The expiration date can be found printed on the pharmacy’s label or stamped on the bottle or carton after EXP.  If the expiration date has passed, don’t take the medication and return the remaining pills to your local pharmacy.
M: If you’re not sure about the expiration date, it’s better to be cautious and have a confirmation from your pharmacist that it is ok to take since the expiration date ensures the efficacy of your treatment.


What to do with the expired medication?

P: What should I do with expired medication?
M: Bring all expired or unused medication to your local pharmacy for proper and safe disposal. Flushing them down the toilet or putting them in the trash can harm the environment or lead to misuse.


Use after expiration date?

P: Is it okay to use medications after the expiration date? / Are expired drugs still safe to take?/I took an expired pill, will I be okay?
M: Most medications do not become toxic after they expire. However, no one can guarantee their efficacy or safety. Therefore it is best if you refill your medication rather than using expired stock. Speak to your pharmacist about it.

Traveling with HIV
Time management

P: I’m traveling, when can I take my meds?
M: There are two main options when traveling to different time zones :
M: Option 1 : stay on your local time. If the lag is short, it is generally easier to switch to the new time zone - that is, if you take medication at 11:00 p.m. in your local time and the time difference is -1 hour, take it at 10:00 p.m. in your holiday time zone.
M: Option 2 : switch to the same time in the new time zone, and then back when you return. 
M: When the time difference is large, the main principle is that it is easier and safer to advance the dosing time than to delay it. 
M: With a once-daily medication, you do not want to exceed 24 hours, but you can bring it forward by 6, 8 or even 12 hours, i.e. if you are taking medication at 11 p.m. in your local time and the time difference is -12 hours , take it first at 11 a.m. and resume at 11 p.m. and then continue with the new schedule.
M: Although bringing a dose of forward will give you slightly higher levels of each medication, it is very safe for such a short period of time.
M: What is the jetlag between your current city and your destination? (e.g: Montreal -> Paris = +6, Paris -> Montreal = -6)
P: +6 
	M: At what time do you usually take your dose? Please indicate am or pm (e.g. 10:00 am).
P: time_origin
M: So, you could take your meds at time_new at the new local time or at time_new-12 once and continue your normal dose at time_new. Which one do you prefer?
M: During your last trip, or during these days of travel, did you often feel that your travel made it difficult for you to take your medication? For example, did you delay or skip your dose?
P: yes, always, often, sometimes, no, never, etc…
	→  Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-1

They will be able to provide you with more detailed information."

Travel tips
The following are some advice to consider when travelling as a tourist or on business trips with antiretroviral medication.

1
Always carry your medication in your hand luggage (carry-on). Checked luggage might get lost or delayed.
2
Rebottle the medication in neutral packaging and make sure it is properly labelled by your pharmacy (this means without mentioning the nature or brand name of the drugs).
3
Always take a few days of extra medication with you. You may not be able to return on the scheduled date. It can be difficult to get prescriptions for these drugs in another country and they might be very expensive. Finally, if you receive a prescription in another country, you may not receive exactly the same medicines as you take.


4
You may need to check the specific customs regulations for importing your medicines.For more information, please see here [https://www.hivtravel.org/Default.aspx?pageId=152]. In almost all cases, the importation of medicines for personal use should not be a problem. To be careful, carry a doctor's prescription in English. The prescription should not mention HIV. 
5
Do not unnecessarily disclose your HIV status. Not to other travelers, nor to customs or immigration officials - it's none of their business. Be aware that people living with HIV are stigmatized in many countries. 
6
If you are staying in a country for a long time, or if your health is fragile, make sure you know where the next HIV clinic is, or get the address of an HIV clinician. It might be a good idea to get in touch with a local HIV organization.
7
If you are taking substitution treatment, you should check the specific regulations in this regard before traveling. Some countries view substitution treatment as using illicit drugs.
8
If you plan to stop your medication when traveling to a country with an entry bar, it is imperative that you consult your HIV clinician or pharmacist well before doing so, otherwise you take the risk of developing new or additional resistances that could pose significant future health risks. Also remember that if you stop taking ART, you may feel ill during your trip and you may also be more infectious.

M: In general, hepatitis A and B vaccines are recommended for all travellers. People with HIV should avoid live vaccines such as cholera, typhoid, yellow fever and smallpox (vaccinia). If the country you are going to requires any of these vaccines, you can talk with your doctor and get a letter to explain that you have a medical reason for not getting vaccinated.

P: I lost my medication during a trip, what can I do?
P: What can I do if I lose my medication during a trip?
 
 
M: Are you still on Canadian territory?
 
If YES
 
M:  Prescriptions from most canadian providers are valid across the country. You can request a prescription transfer at the nearest pharmacy. Explain the situation, give them the name of the medication. Provide your current pharmacy's contact information. The new pharmacy will contact your usual pharmacy and take care of most of the process. They might not be able to bill your insurance, thus you might have to pay for your medication. Send the receipt to your insurance so they give you reimbursement.
 
If NO
 
M: Many countries do not permit pharmacies to fill prescriptions that originate outside their country.
M: If that’s the case, you may need to be seen by a local doctor who can prescribe the medication for you.
M: Have a clear hospital or pharmacy label with both the generic and brand names of the medication or a copy of the prescription to facilitate the consultation.
M: Let me remind you that it is not a good idea to have someone ship your medications from back home. In some countries, this is considered drug importation, which is often forbidden. Sending prescription medications through the mail poses a risk of damaging the medication through inappropriate storage conditions (may be exposed to heat or freezing). You should double-check with the postal service and customs before relying on this backup plan. Also, it is common for packages to be delayed, lost or damaged while passing through customs.

General Information for PLHIV
Basic HIV facts
HIV definition

P: What is HIV?
M: Human immunodeficiency virus or HIV is a virus that affects the immune system and, without treatment, can lead to severe complications like infections and cancers and to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 

P: What is the difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2 ? What is HIV 1? What is HIV 2? How do HIV1 and HIV 2 differ?

M: HIV 1 and HIV 2 share many similarities such as their basic gene arrangement, modes of transmission, and they both treatment with antiretroviral treatment (ART), and can result in AIDS. 

M: However, there are differences between their retroviral pathogenesis, and it is still not fully understood. 

M: In terms of epidemiology, HIV 2 is largely confined to West Africa, while HIV 1 extends worldwide. 
M: However, HIV 1 constitutes more than 95% of all HIV patients, so it is rare to see HIV 2 patients in Canada.

M: HIV 2 infected individuals mostly remain non-progressive, whereas most HIV 1 infected patients progress. 
M: Also, HIV 2 infected individuals tend to have a longer period of having no symptoms when compared with HIV 1 individuals.
M: Viral loads are consistently low in HIV 2 patients, which means that patients can maintain average levels of immune activation. 

M: However, HIV 1 and HIV 2 share many similarities such as their basic gene arrangement, modes of transmission, treatment with antiretroviral treatment (ART), and complication into AIDS. 


P: Can  I have both HIV 1 and HIV 2 at the same time?
	M: Yes

P: How can I know if I have HIV 1 or HIV 2?
M: You can undergo a test using Geenius HIV1/2 Confirmatory assay that is available at public health laboratories in Canada.

Signs and symptoms

P: What are the signs and symptoms of an HIV infection?
M: During the first 2 to 4 weeks after the infection, at least 50 % of people living with HIV may experience, for a few days to weeks, mild symptoms resembling those of flu such as chills, fever, fatigue, joint pain, headache, sore throat, muscle aches or swollen lymph nodes.
M: Not everyone who gets HIV experiences symptoms in the early stage of the infection. Therefore, it is important to get tested if you are at risk, even if you do not have symptoms. 


HIV diagnosis

P: How is HIV diagnosed?
M: The diagnosis is made with a blood test. As not everyone experiences symptoms in the early stage of the infection, it is important to get tested if you think there is a risk you may have been exposed to HIV. 
M: Of note, not all tests can detect HIV during the early stage of the infection (first 2-4 weeks): a negative test might have to be repeated. 
M: The period following exposure during which a test cannot detect if you have HIV is called the window period. Different persons and types of HIV tests will have different window periods ranging from 2 weeks to 3 months.

M: Would you like to know where to get tested for HIV in Canada?
P: Y or N
IF Y:
	M: You can visit the following web page by CATIE: https://whereto.catie.ca/

		IF Y: Go to answer below.
		IF N: Let me know if you have any other questions.

IF N: Would you like to know more about the process of HIV testing in Canada?
M: Would you like to know how to get tested for HIV in Canada? 
P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: The process can be summarized by  the following steps:
Consent: there are 2 approaches: opt-in (active consent is needed for the test to occur) or opt-out approach (there is assumption of consent if you  do not refuse the test after being informed that it will be done by a healthcare provider); 
Pre-test counselling: this is necessary to get an informed consent, you  have to have all the necessary information to decide or not to get tested. This information can include the modes of transmission of HIV, the risk factors, the preventative measures as well as information on the test (advantages, disadvantages, types of test, procedure, interpretation). 
Information collection: there are 3 options for the information collection. First option, your  name can be attached to the test’s request, result, report and record (called nominal testing). Second option, your name  is not on the  test’s request, but used for report and record (called non-nominal/identifying testing). Third option, your name is not  used for the test’s request, nor for the report and record of the test’s result (called in anonymous testing). 
Type of test: the test can be done in a laboratory (standard test), in which case another appointment might be needed to discuss the results, or it can be done right away, in which case the results are available during the same appointment (point-of-care test). With a point-of-care test, the result can be non-reactive, which means negative, and no further test is needed, or reactive, which means likely positive, however another test needs to be done in a laboratory to confirm the result and another appointment will be needed to discuss the final result. 
Post-test counselling: depending on the result, the healthcare provider will have a discussion with you l regarding any questions you might have, what are the next steps in terms of support, resources and follow-up needed. After getting a test result, everyone should be provided with post-test counselling to assist them in understanding what the result means for them, what is available to support them and how to access those resources and care. 

Notification to the local Public Health department and partner(s) if positive: in Canada, HIV diagnoses have to be reported to the local public health department of the province of territory, the only exception is in Quebec where HIV surveillance is done through healthcare providers inputting anonymous data in the provincial database. Regarding partner notification (also called contact-tracing), laws vary by province and territory, but, in general, individuals who test positive for HIV either have to contact the partners with whom they had sexual relationships or shared drugs with or give the necessary information to the healthcare provider or a public health nurse for them to contact the partners, this will be done, as much as possible, without divulging the individual’s identity.

Linkage to care: in the event of a positive test result, an individual should be provided with information on care (treatment, support, prevention of transmission) and how to access it, as well as with resources including services provided by community organizations. In the event of a negative test, understanding that an individual may still be at risk, there are services that can be offered in order to reduce their risk of acquiring an HIV infection in the future. Would you like to know more about those services?

 HIV Non-Disclosure 

P: Before having sex, should I tell my partner that I’m HIV infected?
	M: What I am about to tell you is legal information, not legal advice.
M: Telling someone you have HIV is your decision. But to help you decide, think of someone who will respect your privacy, not judge you, and can give you the support you need and deserve. 
M: However, disclosing becomes a legal obligation if there is a realistic possibility of transmitting HIV. While the courts have not clearly defined what "realistic possibility" means, you can select one of these options and we’ll tell you the possibility of HIV transmission:
Oral sex, deep kissing, human bite
Anal sex, vaginal sex

IF A = 
M: The HIV transmission risk is low. 
M:  If there is no realistic possibility of transmission, failure to disclose will not constitute a crime.
M: a realistic possibility of transmission is negated if:
viral load is low (under 200 copies per ml of blood) at the time of sexual relations due to anti-retroviral therapy
a condom was used


IF B =
M: The transmission risk is high. 
M: Disclosure of HIV status prior to sexual activity is required where there is a realistic possibility of transmission..
M: M: a realistic possibility of transmission is negated if:
viral load is low (under 200 copies per ml of blood) at the time of sexual relations due to anti-retroviral therapy
a condom was used


M: Are you receiving antiretroviral therapy?


The Supreme Court of Canada held in R v Mabior  that disclosure of HIV status prior to sexual activity was required where there is a realistic possibility of transmission.
Sexual activity with a HIV positive person poses a negligible risk of transmission where that person has maintained a suppressed viral load (i.e., a viral load of under 200 copies per ml of blood) as a result of anti-retroviral therapy. This is the case regardless of whether a condom was used.


Certain types of sexual activity with a person living with HIV pose a low risk of transmission: 

Sexual intercourse without a condom with a person who is on anti-retroviral therapy, but has not maintained a suppressed viral load; Sexual intercourse with a condom with a person who is not on treatment; 
Oral sex without a condom with a person who is on anti-retroviral therapy, but has not maintained a suppressed viral load; 
and, Oral sex without a condom with a person who is not on treatment;

P: Y or N 

IF Y: 

M: Is your Viral load under 200 copies/ml of blood? 

P: Y 

M: The Supreme Court of Canada held in R v Mabior that disclosure of HIV status prior to sexual activity was required where there is a realistic possibility of transmission. If there is no realistic possibility of transmission, failure to disclose will not constitute a crime.

Sexual activity with an HIV positive person poses a negligible risk of transmission where that person has maintained a suppressed viral load (i.e., a viral load of under 200 copies per ml of blood) as a result of ART.

In Ontario, B.C., Alberta, and Quebec, you now shouldn’t be prosecuted if you are on treatment and have maintained a suppressed viral load (under 200 copies/ml); this applies whether or not you used a condom. In B.C., you shouldn’t be prosecuted if you only had oral sex.

M: Read more here https://www.hivlegalnetwork.ca/site/the-criminalization-of-hiv-non-disclosure-in-canada-report/?lang=en

P: Do you have any tips on how to reduce my risk on getting charges and convictions?
	M: 1. Before having sex, do not assume that your sex partner knows you have HIV. 
Tell your sex partner clearly that you have HIV, like "I am HIV positive".. 
M: 2. See your doctor regularly to get your HIV viral load tested every three to six months.
M: 3. Use condoms that are made from either latex or polyurethane, and lube that are either water-based or silicone-based.
M: 4. Have a concrete proof of you disclosing of having HIV to your sex partner and asking for informed consent.

P: Do I need to tell my doctor or dentist if I have HIV?
	M: You don’t have to, but if they know, they will be able to give you the treatment you need.


HIV transmission

P: How is HIV transmitted?
M: HIV is transmitted through five body fluids: blood, semen (pre-ejaculatory fluid as well), rectal fluid, vaginal fluid and breast milk. 
M: It can be transmitted through sex, shared drug equipment such as needles (also if used for tattoo, piercing or acupuncture) and from mother to child during pregnancy, birth or breastfeeding. Do you want to know how HIV is NOT transmitted?
P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: HIV cannot be transmitted through handshakes, hugs, kisses, coughing, sneezing, spitting, eating together, pool water, toilet seats, water fountains, animals or insects. In fact, HIV cannot be transmitted through intact healthy skin.

HIV transmission prevention

P: How can HIV transmission be prevented?
M: It depends on your HIV status. Are you living with HIV?
P: Y or N or not sure
IF Y
M: 1. Adhere to the antiretroviral therapy (ART) to attain and maintain an undetectable viral load which means you cannot sexually transmit HIV to others as undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).
M: 2. Use condoms and water or silicone-based lubricants (avoid oil-based ones as they can damage condoms).
M: 5. Do not share sex toys, drug injection equipment or needles when getting a tattoo, piercing or acupuncture. Always use new and sterile equipment.
M: 7. If you are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant, you can prevent transmission to your baby by being on treatment and having an undetectable viral load before and throughout your pregnancy. Moreover, formula feeding is recommended over breastfeeding to prevent postnatal transmission in Canada. 

IF N or not sure : 
M: 2. Use condoms and water or silicone-based lubricants (avoid oil-based ones as they can damage condoms).
M: 3. Consider taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) if you are an HIV-negative individual at higher risk of contracting HIV.
M: 4. Take post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), in the 72 hours following exposure to HIV, if you are an HIV-negative individual who may have been exposed to the virus.
M: 5. Do not share sex toys, drug injection equipment or needles when getting a tattoo, piercing or acupuncture. Always use new and sterile equipment.
M: 6. Get tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as hepatitis C if you are at risk.
M: 7. If you are pregnant or considering becoming pregnant, HIV testing is recommended. HIV transmission to the baby can occur during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding. However, when a woman living with HIV is treated for her infection all throughout her pregnancy, the transmission risk is much lower.  

P: How should I use a condom properly? What is a proper way to use a condom? Are there any special methods to use condoms?

M:  It is very important to use a condom properly during sexual intercourse. There are two main types of condoms: external and internal condom.

How to use an external condom

Carefully open and remove the condom from the wrapper.
Place the condom on the tip of the hard penis. If uncircumcised, pull back the foreskin first.
Pinch the air out of the tip of the condom. While holding the tip, unroll the condom all the way down the penis.
After sex but before pulling out, hold the bottom of the condom and carefully pull out the penis.
Carefully remove the condom and throw it in the trash.
If you feel the condom break any time during sex, stop immediately, pull out the penis, take off the broken condom, and put on a new condom.

Use water-based or silicone-based lubricants during sex to help keep the condom from tearing. Don’t use oil-based lubricants because they can weaken the condom and cause it to break.

How to use an internal condom

Carefully open and remove the condom from the package.
While holding the condom at the closed end, squeeze the sides of the inner ring together and insert it into the vagina or anus.
Use your finger to push the inner ring up until it rests against the cervix in the vagina or as far into the anus as it can go.
Be sure the condom is not twisted. The thin, outer ring should remain outside the vagina or anus.
Guide your partner’s penis into the opening of the condom.
After sex, gently twist the outer ring and pull the condom out.
Carefully throw the condom in the trash after using it one time.
Stop intercourse if you feel the penis slip between the condom and the walls of the vagina/anus or if the outer ring is pushed into the vagina/anus.

Use lubricant during sex to help keep the condom from slipping or tearing. It is safe to use any lubricant with an internal condom.



HIV cure

P: Is there a cure for HIV? 
M: There is presently no cure or vaccine for HIV, but research is ongoing. However, HIV can be treated with medications in order to prevent transmission and progression to more severe disease. 
M: Although the infection cannot be effectively cured for the moment, the efficacy of the current treatment is such that the infection is now considered a chronic illness, rather than an acute and terminal infection. By starting HIV treatment, called antiretroviral therapy (ART), as soon as possible and adhering to it, people living with HIV can have a good quality of life.
M: In fact, are you familiar with the concept of U=U? 
P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: Perfect! U=U is a very important goal to achieve and only 50% of HIV patients know what it means.
M: If you ever forget or want to know more about U=U, let me know!
IF N: go to U=U

CD4 definition

P: What does CD4 count mean? 
M: CD4 T cells are a type of lymphocytes, which are immune cells, or a part of the white blood cells. These cells are the ones infected by HIV. Therefore, the CD4 count gives information about the state of your immune system. Normally, the CD4 count should be at least 500 cells/mm3. 
M: A lower CD4 count increases the risk of complications such as infections: a CD4 count lower than 200 cells/mm3 in a person living with HIV indicates the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Taking and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) can allow your CD4 count to go up and, potentially, be maintained at a normal level. 

Viral load definition

P: What does viral load mean?
M: The viral load is the quantity of virus found in your blood. This value gives information about treatment adherence and effectiveness. 
M: Indeed, by taking and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART), you can attain and maintain an undetectable viral load. By undetectable, we mean that the amount of virus in your blood is lower than what the test can detect. 
M: Do you know what undetectable = untransmittable (U=U) means? 

P: Y or N
IF Y:
M: Perfect! U=U is a very important goal to achieve and only 50% of HIV patients know what it means.
M: If you ever forget or want to know more about U=U, let me know!
IF N: go to U=U

ART definition

P: What does ART mean?
M: ART stands for antiretroviral therapy, it is what we call HIV treatment as HIV is a retrovirus. HIV treatment is also known as combination therapy, combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Some people also call it triple therapy.
M: ART consists of a combination of HIV drugs from two or more classes which can be taken as a single pill, as multiple pills or even as intramuscular injections, depending on the regimen, every day for the pills and every 2 months for the injections. 
M: Nowadays, many HIV regimens exist, you can talk with your health care professional to find the right one for you.  




Vaccinations

P: If I am HIV positive which vaccines can I have?
M: People with HIV may have different responses to vaccinations depending on the health of their immune systems. Firstly, do you know the number of your CD4 cells?
P: Y or N or CD4 number(skip the next question)
If Y→ 
M: Can you tell me the number?
	P: CD4 number

9.   Varicella vaccine to protect against chickenpox if you were born in 1980 or after and have not gotten two doses of this vaccine or do not have immunity to this disease
M: Don’t forget! People with HIV should work with their health care providers to determine which vaccines they should receive and when they should receive them.
 If CD4<200 🡪 
M: Good! You can talk with your doctor or pharmacist about these vaccines:
1.   Influenza vaccine each year to protect against seasonal flu

3.   Influenza (flu)
4.   Meningococcal
5.   Pneumococcacovidl (pneumonia)
6.   Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). A single vaccine called Tdap protects adolescents and adults against the three diseases. Every 10 years, a repeat vaccine against tetanus and diphtheria (called Td) is recommended.
7. COVID
M: Additional vaccines may be recommended for a person with HIV based on the person’s age, previous vaccinations, risk factors for a particular disease, or certain HIV-related factors.
M: Don’t forget! People with HIV should work with their health care providers to determine which vaccines they should receive and when they should receive them.


Idée supplémentaire: M : Do you have a specific concern regarding one of these vaccines?

Type of covid vaccine

P: Which covid vaccine should I get?
M: You should get the vaccine that is available to you. The vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca are all approved vaccines in Canada, They are effective against COVID-19 and safe to use in people living with HIV.

Stop medication when vaccinated

P: Should I stop taking my medication when I get vaccinated?
M: No, all approved vaccines have no interaction with HIV medication. Stopping your antiretroviral medication could put you at higher risk for HIV-related illnesses and drug resistance. 
M: By the way, have you ever thought of stopping your treatment?
P: Y or N
IF Y: go to Stop treatment
IF N: 
M: Great! Keep up the good work and remember to take your medication on time!

Covid-19 risk for HIV patients

Life expectancy
P: What is the life expectancy for people living with HIV?
M: People living with HIV (PLHIV) live increasingly longer lives. However, life expectancy depends on many factors not related to HIV such as social and economic circumstances, gender, genetics, etc. 
M: PLHIV are more likely to have comorbidities such as diabetes, chronic liver, lung, kidney disease, which is why in many studies, PLHIV still live, on average, a few years less than people not living with HIV.
M: In general, follow the same guidance on healthy living habits including healthy diet, regular exercise, avoid smoking and excess alcohol drinking. Apart from taking your treatment against HIV, these are the most susceptible to guarantee a healthy life.
M: Of course, having access to effective HIV treatment will help prolong life expectancy, as well as being undetectable and starting treatment early.
M: Would you like to have tips on treatment adherence?
P: Y or N
	IF Y: 
M: go to tips for medication adherence scenario

 Blood donation
P: Can I donate blood or plasma?
M: Are you living with HIV?
P: Y or N
	IF Y: 
M: Unfortunately, people living with HIV cannot donate blood, plasma or any other components of blood to the Canadian Blood Services or to Héma-Québec.  However, if you are unable to donate, but want to invest in the cause of blood donation, blood donation centres are regularly calling for volunteers.
IF N:
M : There are certain criterias to determine your eligibility for blood donation. 
M: Here are the criterias for eligibility for blood donation in Québec:

 Organ/tissue donation
P: Can I donate organs or human tissues?
M: Are you living with HIV?
P: Y or N
	IF Y: 
M: Unfortunately, people living with HIV cannot donate human tissues (as per Héma-Québec, these include ligaments, tendons, parts of bones, arteries, cardiac valves, skin and corneas) in Québec, as confirmed by Héma-Québec, the organization that coordinates human tissue donation in this province. 
M: Regarding organ donation, Transplant Québec has confirmed that there is no exclusion criteria for becoming a potential living organ donor (kidney, part of liver) or a potential organ donor after one’s death in Québec. Indeed, assessment is done on a case-by-case basis. 
M: Outside of Québec, the different provinces have their own specifications on organ and tissue donation and you can consult the information by province here: https://organtissuedonation.ca/en?_ga=2.156070840.265414420.1629565204-616991922.1629565204

 U=U

P: What is U=U?
M: U=U means that people living with HIV who achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load—the amount of HIV in the blood—by taking and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed cannot sexually transmit the virus to others. But remember, U=U only applies to HIV and not to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
M: In short, when HIV is undetectable, it is sexually untransmittable.

Undetectable time

P: How long will my viral load become undetectable if I start taking my ARV medications?
M: When a person first begins treatment, it usually takes three to six months for the viral load to become undetectable. However, not everyone’s viral load becomes and remains undetectable on treatment. This most commonly happens when someone doesn't take their medication regularly to medications. It can also occur due to drug resistance. 
M: Why are you asking this? Are you concerned about your health status?
P: Y or N	
	IF yes→ 
M: Does this concern always make it difficult for you to take your HIV medication? Or maybe sometimes?
P: yes, always, sometimes, often, no, never, etc…
		If yes, always, sometimes → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-5
M: Ok. Good. Remember, a high level of adherence to ART medications will help you reach and maintain an undetectable viral load, which will help you stay healthy.
M: Also, if you have any other questions about your health during the treatment process, don't hesitate to ask. I will do my best to help you.
	ELSE (if no for the first question or never for the second) → Marvin saves answer as never for I-Score 6-5
M: Good to know that. Also, an undetectable viral load does not mean that you have been cured of HIV. The virus is still present at very low amounts in the body when the viral load is undetectable. Therefore, it is important to always take your medication as scheduled and to work with your doctor to determine an appropriate schedule for medical check-ups and viral load monitoring.

Undetectable definition

P: What does “undetectable” mean?
M: Undetectable means that there are fewer copies of the virus in your blood than the test can measure. In Canada, an undetectable viral load is usually defined as less than 40 or 50 copies/ml. 
	M: Why are you asking this? Are you concerned about your health status?
P: Y or N
	IF yes→ 
M: Does this concern always make it difficult for you to take your HIV medication? Or maybe sometimes?
P: yes, always, sometimes, often, no, never, etc…
IF yes, always, sometimes → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-5
M: Ok. Good. Remember, always taking your ARTwill help you reach and maintain an undetectable viral load, which will help you stay healthy.
M: Newer ART is safer, simpler and more effective than when it was first introduced. ART today is so effective that for most people, the virus is well controlled within three to six months of starting treatment. The amount of virus in their blood then becomes undetectable. With this effective treatment, life expectancy for HIV patients is close to normal.
M: Also, if you have any other questions about your health during the treatment process, don't hesitate to ask. I will do my best to help you.
ELSE (if no for the first question or never for the second) → Marvin saves answer as never for I-Score 6-5
M: Good to know that. Also, an undetectable viral load does not mean that you have been cured of HIV. The virus is still present at very low amounts in the body when the viral load is undetectable. Therefore, it is important to always take your medication and to work with your doctor to determine an appropriate schedule for medical check-ups and viral load monitoring.

How to know if undetectable

P: What should I do to verify if i’m undetectable?
M:The only way to know is to have regular viral load tests. If your viral load becomes detectable again, there may be a risk of HIV transmission. An ongoing detectable viral load may also indicate that your HIV treatment is no longer working properly. If your viral load becomes detectable, talk to your doctor.
M: Why are you asking this? Are you concerned about your health status?
P: Y or N
IF yes → 	
M: Does this concern always make it difficult for you to take your HIV medication? Or maybe sometimes?
P: yes, always, sometimes, often, no, never, etc…
IF yes, always, sometimes → Marvin saves answer as it is for I-Score 6-5
M: Ok. Good. Remember, always take your medication will help you reach and maintain an undetectable viral load, which will help you stay healthy.
M: Meanwhile, a person on ART needs to work with their doctor to determine an appropriate schedule for medical check-ups and viral load monitoring.
M: Also, if you have any other questions about your health during the treatment process, don't hesitate to ask. I will do my best to help you.
	ELSE (if no for the first question or never for the second) → Marvin saves answer as never for I-Score 6-5
M: Good to know that. Also, an undetectable viral load does not mean that you have been cured of HIV. The virus is still present at very low amounts in the body when the viral load is undetectable. Therefore, it is important to maintain good adherence and to work with your doctor to determine an appropriate schedule for medical check-ups and viral load monitoring.

Untransmittable definition

P: What does “untransmittable” mean?
M: For as long as your viral load is undetectable you will not sexually transmit HIV, making your HIV "untransmittable". In other words, HIV will not be passed sexually to another person through saliva, pre-seminal fluids, semen, rectal fluids or vaginal fluids. 
M: As the scientific evidence currently stands, U=U applies only to sexual transmission, and not to other types of transmissions (sharing needles or other injection equipment, birth or breastfeeding).

U=U & type of sex
Situation 1:

P: Does U=U apply to all types of sex? / Can I  have oral sex with my partner if I have an undetectable viral load?
M: Yes. People living with HIV with an undetectable viral load do not transmit HIV through insertive or receptive anal sex, vaginal sex, or oral sex.

Situation 2:

P: What kind of sex can I have if my viral load is undetectable?
M: People living with HIV with an undetectable viral load do not transmit HIV through insertive or receptive anal sex, vaginal sex, or oral sex.

PrEP
Definition

P: What is PrEP? / Can you explain what PrEP is?
M: PrEP stands for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It’s a treatment that people without HIV can take to reduce the risk of getting infected or transmitting HIV by taking antiretroviral drugs. PrEP does not offer protection against other STIs than HIV. Do you want to know more about this treatment?
P: Y or N
	IF Y: 
M: There are 2 types of PrEP available in Canada:
M: 1) Daily PrEP consists of taking one pill each day regularly.
M: 2) The on-demand PrEP can be used in particular cases depending on the type of exposure and if the person is at a higher risk only during a particular period of time. Your health care provider will help you choose the most appropriate option for you.
M: PrEP will also require many follow-up appointments with your health care provider and many laboratory tests.
	IF N: 
		M: Let me know if you have any more questions.
Preventive treatment

P: How does the PrEP preventive treatment work?
M: The PrEP drug in your body will prevent the HIV from multiplying and surviving in your body and thus reduces the risk of getting infected.
M: However, the drug level needs to remain high, so taking PrEP as prescribed and not missing doses is very important. 
M: If taken correctly, PrEP is effective to prevent sexual HIV infections. 


Indications

P: Who should take PrEP? 
M: People who are HIV-negative and are at a high risk of getting HIV can benefit from a PrEP treatment.  
M: Here are examples of situations that can put someone at high risk of getting HIV: having a sexual relationship with an HIV-positive person, sharing needles, having multiple or unknown-status sexual partners, etc.
M: These are only some examples, so if you believe you are at high risk of getting HIV, you can talk to your healthcare provider to see if you are eligible for PrEP. In the meantime, you can do this quiz (in french only: https://maprep.org/la-prep-est-elle-pour-moi/) to evaluate if PrEP could be a good option for you, however, this quiz does not replace a discussion with your healthcare provider about PrEP.

Cost
P: Does PrEP cost money?
M: PrEP is covered by most public and private insurance plans in Canada. You may still have to pay a fee depending on the plan that you have.
M: Specifically in Quebec, the PrEP is considered just the same way as any other essential medication, and covered by all insurance plans. 
M : Here are the different insurance plans that exist: https://www.maprep.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tableau-prep.png
M: Fees may change or not be completely accurate. 

Side effects
P: What are the side effects of PrEP?
M: PrEP is generally well tolerated. Sides effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache are mild and temporary. 
M: For a small number of people, PrEP is associated with a small decrease in kidney, bone and rarely liver health. However, these decreases were reversible after stopping PrEP. 
M: It is therefore important to have follow-up appointments to monitor these side effects.


Prescription

P: Where can I get PrEP? How do I get PrEP?
M: PrEP is a prescription medication that you can get from a doctor who will be in charge of doing follow-ups with you.
If you live in Quebec, you can consult the PVSQ database of the testing centers for HIV: https://pvsq.org/sites-de-depistages/ 
M: These centers can refer individuals who would be eligible for PrEP to a doctor who will follow them. 
If you live in Ontario, you can visit this webpage by the Ontario HIV Treatment Network where you will find a map of the different clinics providing services related to PrEP: https://ontarioprep.ca/clinic-finder/


Alternatives

P: Are there any treatment alternatives?
M: First, you can use this risk estimator to have an idea of the risk of contracting HIV during various sexual activities between an individual who is HIV-positive and one who is HIV-negative: https://hivrisk.cdc.gov/risk-estimator-tool/#-sb
M: Of note, other forms of PrEP, including vaginal or rectal gels, intravaginal rings and long-lasting injections, are still in development phases and will not be available to patients anytime soon.
M: Also, there are many ways to lower your HIV infection risk, whether you are taking PrEP or not. Would you like to know more about these?
	IF Y: see HIV transmission prevention scenario (6.1.5), section NOT living with HIV. 
IF N: Let me know if you have any other questions.


Removed: M: Adopting preventive measures, getting tested regularly, getting appropriate treatment if tested positive.


 PEP 

Definition 

P: What is PEP?
M: PEP - Post-exposure prophylaxis, is a HIV medication combination given to help reduce  the risk of getting HIV, to a HIV-negative person who may have been exposed to the virus. PEP treatment should be started as early as possible within 72 hours, for best prevention effect. PEP is not a replacement for highly effective prevention methods for example like condoms and PreP, and should only be taken in emergencies. Would you like to know more about PEP? 

if Y:
M: PEP is a combination of three HIV-medications that is taken daily for 28 days to minimize the risk of a HIV-negative getting HIV after a potential exposure.It is important to start with PEP within 72 hours after potential exposure, for best effectiveness. The sooner the treatment, the more likely the medications are able to suppress the virus replication. PEP is not the same as PrEP, that is given to prevent getting the virus for HIV-negative in high risk of contracting before being exposed. 

if N: Let me know if you have other questions. 

P: Who can take PEP? 
PEP can be used by HIV-negative individuals who have been exposed to the virus.For example, in a work context, a healthcare worker that might have been exposed through a needle-stick injury. This is known as Occupational PEP. Non-occupational PEP is PEP Treatment because of non-work related situations, such as rape, unprotected sex, a broken condom or sharing of needles. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, I would suggest contacting your healthcare provider. 

access
p: Where can I access PEP? 
M: Most emergency departments should have PEP available to start the treatment as quickly as possible. If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, I would highly suggest contacting your healthcare provider.
M: The healthcare provider decides who should be put on PEP based on the individuals case. They also do the follow ups and monitoring while you are taking the medication. 
M: PEP “starter packs” may be offered by yur health care provider or provided by most emergency departments for immediate start of treatment, following a prescription for you to fill in order to receive the full 28-day treatment. 
M. non-occupational PEP is not known to all healthcare providers, or they may be reluctant to prescribe it.



Treatment
P: how effective is PEP?
m: while it does not prevent 100% of HIV infections, it is still highly effective if used correctly and consistently for the 28 days of treatment.
m: proper measures in treatment can protect more than 80% of HIV-infections. 
m: it is important to note that PEP is taken to reduce the risk from a single exposure to HIV. Therefore taking extra measures in prevention of being exposed to HIV again ( for example using condoms) while taking PEP is also an important asset in the treatment and in general. 
m: Condoms, PrEP and other highly effective prevention methods are the most effective prevention methods for HIV-negative individuals. PEP is not a replacement as an ongoing prevention strategy for HIV.
M: People who on a daily hold often find themselves at risk for HIV, should consider using PrEP instead. Would you like to know more about PrEP?


if Y: PREP definition:
N: Let me know if there is more I can help you with. 

P: Is there any side effects with taking PEP, are there any precautions to think about taking PEP?
M: Taking extra measures in prevention of being exposed to HIV again ( for example using condoms) while taking PEP is also an important asset whilst being treatment aswell. There is a possibility of developing resistance to the treatment, if you get re exposed to HIV while being on PEP. If you develop resistance to the PEP medications, then there might not be effective in the treatment for HIV either. Although the recommended PEP medications in Canada are usually well tolerated and with few side effects, some of the side effects are nausea, diarrhea and fatigue with a severity that varies from person to person and on the type of medication. 


Cost

m: It depends, was the exposure work related or not work related?
p: work related 
m: work related exposure is normally covered by your workplace insurance

Women’s health

Breastfeeding

Transmission
P: Can I breastfeed my baby if I'm HIV positive
P: How long can I breastfeed my baby for if I’m HIV positive
P: Can HIV be transmitted through breast milk?
P: Can a HIV positive mother breastfeed her baby?
P: Is it okay to breastfeed if you are HIV positive?
P: is mixed feeding OK for newborns if I have HIV?
P: Is it OK to mix feed my newborn?
P: Is partial breastfeeding beneficial if I have HIV?

M: Maternal antiretroviral therapy significantly reduces but does not eliminate the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding. Therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended for individuals with HIV.
M:  If you are HIV positive, it is recommended to avoid breastfeeding. Using formula feeding exclusively is the safest option to ensure the baby stays HIV negative. 
M: Studies have shown that breast milk has HIV and babies have been infected with HIV through breast milk.


Transmission if undetectable
P: Is breastfeeding good while on HIV medications?
P: Can I breastfeed if I have an undetectable viral load?
 
M: It is recommended to avoid breastfeeding.
M: When you are undetectable, the risk of transmission through breast milk is lower but the risk still exists.
M: Using formula feeding exclusively is the safest option to ensure the baby stays HIV negative

M: I have more information  about this subject. Press Continue if you want more explanations. 

1
M: Studies have shown that HIV can hide in breast milk.
M:  Even if you are taking anti-HIV medications regularly and you have a low viral load in the blood, HIV can still be hiding in breast milk.
 
2
M: HIV medication can be present in breastmilk and might go into your baby’s system.
M: It’s not known how this will impact the baby’s development over time.
M: If the baby becomes HIV positive, their HIV might not respond to some treatments because of drug resistance
 
3
M: keep in mind that in the weeks following childbirth, some moms might go through challenging times, which makes it difficult to fully adhere to antiretroviral treatments.
M: This may cause them to have breakthrough virus in their system and increase the risk of HIV infection for the baby.

4. 
M: Infant formula feeding is a safe alternative to breastfeeding.

Pregnancy and HIV

	Transmitting HIV through Pregnancy

P: I want to have kids, but I am afraid to pass HIV to my child. What should I do?
P: I have HIV, and I want kids. Will my child get HIV?
P: How can I avoid transmitting HIV to my baby?
P: Will my child get HIV if I get pregnant?

	M: Don't worry! Thanks to proper HIV-treatment, today HIV-positive individuals  are able to give birth to HIV-negative children. Are you currently on HIV treatment ? 

If Y: The longer before pregnancy that you are on treatment the better. As long as you are continuing your treatment and remain undetectable throughout the pregnancy, you will not have to worry about transmitting the virus to your baby during pregnancy. However there are some medicines to avoid during pregnancy, especially during the first 3 months. You might need to change your HIV treatment, so talking to your doctor that you want to get pregnant would be a great idea. 

If N: 
Ideal recommendation is that you keep an undetectable viral load for at least 6 months before pregnancy. However if you make sure that you are on treatment for at least 3 months, and your viral load remains undetectable at least one month between is also good. 
M: if you are already pregnant, the sooner you start with your HIV-treatment, the better are the chances of not transmitting HIV to your baby, especially if your viral load is high. Another bonus is that it keeps you healthier as well. Contact your doctor for more guidance about your pregnancy. 

Add in Both Y and N:

M: After birth, the baby is also given ARV therapy for 6 weeks to reduce the risk of getting HIV.


P: Is there more things I can do to reduce the chance of transmitting HIV to my baby?

M: Here are some tips to boost your chances of not passing HIV to your baby
Be consistent with taking your medicines, and always discuss with a doctor before changing the interval or dose amount. It is especially important for keeping your viral load low during pregnancy.
Planning a delivery through C-section may be offered if your viral load is high. Some studies prove that taking cesarean section surgery before labour reduced the chances of transmitting HIV to their baby by half. However if the viral load is low and there are no other medical reasons for C-section, a vaginal birth is preferred. 
Chestfeeding is also a no, due to risk of the virus getting passed to your baby through the milk. Luckily there are safe and good alternatives for chestfeeding available.
Talking to someone. Join a support group or talk to a healthcare provider about your worries. Taking care of yourself during pregnancy is just as important for your baby's health.  

M: Do you have more questions for me :)?


ARV and pregnancy 
P Can taking ARV medicines affect me or my baby?

M: Although there are not enough known effects of the safety using some ARV drugs, there are several ARV-s that are proven to be safe for both pregnant women and babies. In Canada today, most pregnant women are given AZT( Retrovir, Zidovine) as part of a regimen in preventing transmission of HIV to their infants. This is the most studied drug for pregnant and babies, and is proven to be safe to take during pregnancy. 

P: Can ARV cause harm to my baby? 

There is only one ARV  that has been linked to birth defects, known as Sustiva (Efavirenz). This medication should be avoided for safety measures. 

Treatment 

P: Which ARV can i take during pregnancy?

ARV-s are generally given in combinations with other medications to prevent drug resistance. However some combinations might cause some complications for pregnant women, and people also react differently to different medicines. If the medications are making you feel unwell, don't stop, nor take a break from taking your medications! Talk to your doctor to find out which medicine would be best suited for you and your baby's interest. Although some may experience discomfort by the medications, for example nausea, the positive effects outways the negative effects! 

If N: Good luck with the pregnancy, and let me know if there is something else I can help you with!

P: What does it mean that my baby has a positive antibody test?
M: An antibody is a product of your immune system for protection against a microbe like in this case HIV, after being exposed to the virus. It is normal that the baby gets a positive HIV antibody test in their first months if the person in labour is HIV positive. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the baby has HIV, just simply been exposed to it. To verify if the baby has HIV, a PCR test is required.

Miscellaneous
Pet poisoning:
 
P: My [pet] ate my pills
P: What happens if a [pet] eats a [meds] pill
P: Is it  dangerous for animals to eat [meds]?

M: Contact your primary care veterinarian or an Animal Poison Control Center in your area as soon as you can.
M: The most useful information you can give is whether your pet vomited right after taking the pills, what type of drug was ingested and how much of the drug was ingested.
M: Here are two US emergency hotlines that can help you manage the situation quickly.
1) ASPCA 1 888 426 4435
2) Pet Poison Helpline 1 855 764 7661 
M: Unfortunately there is no equivalent Canadian service. Since it is an international call, charges may apply.


 
HIV self-test kits
 
What is it?  
M: It’s a test that you where you want, with a friend, a family member or alone.
M: You collect your own blood sample from a finger prick, do the test and interpret the results immediately.  
M: Did you test yourself with a self-test kit?
YES : Do you need help interpreting the results?
NO : Ok. If you need a self-test kit, here are two easy ways that you can get one. [  ]       
 
If YES:
M: Great.
M: Let me remind you that taking the window period into account before interpreting the results is very important.
 
 
If NO:
 
M: If the result is positive, you probably have HIV. However, you should confirm your results by doing another test which will be analysed by a laboratory. Once you have a confirmed positive test, support and many treatment options are available.
 
M: If the result is negative, it may mean you don’t have HIV. However, there are some exceptions. Do you want me to help you interpret your result? YES/NO


When were you last exposed?
 
Recently, less than 3 months ago
-   	You are in the window period. It’s the period of time between when a person has been exposed to HIV and when a test can tell if they have HIV. 
-   	During this period of time the test is not accurate, it can’t detect HIV antibodies presence.
-   	You should be retested 3 months after your first exposure.
-   	A standard laboratory HIV test has a shorter window period and you can know your status quickly.
-   	You can also consider taking PrEP to help prevent HIV. To know more: PrEP.
 
More that 3 months after the last exposure
-   	If performed with no errors and as instructed by the manfacturer, the auto-test is very accurate.
-   	While the chance of a false-negative (a negative test result for a person who is actually HIV positive) is very low, it does exist.
-   	To be 100% sure that you’re negative you need to take a confirmatory laboratory test.
 
 
How does it work?
 
M: The test detects antibodies which are produced in your body 3 to 12 weeks after exposure to HIV.
M: Some people develop antibodies slowly and some people develop them more rapidly.
M: The standard laboratory tests are quicker because they detect a part of the virus itself.

New treatments 

Cabenuva
 
P: What is Cabenuva?

M: Cabenuva is a long-acting injectable drug. It contains two HIV medications:  cabotegravir and rilpivirine.
M: It’s a prescription medicine approved recently in Canada (2020) for the treatment of HIV infection in adults who meet some requirements.
M: Cabenuva needs to be injected deep into muscular tissue in the buttocks by a nurse or a doctor. You’ll get two injections, one into each buttock, once a month or every two months.


P:Who can get Cabenuva?

M: You might be a good candidate for Cabenuva if you are currently on HIV medication, in a stable condition and have been undetectable for some time.
M: Some other exceptions may make you ineligible. Ask your provider about them if you are interested.
M: Would you like to know more about how the treatment with Cabenuva works?

If yes: 
 M: Cabenuva is a complete replacement for your current HIV treatment.
M: Your doctor might start by giving you the Cabenuva equivalent in pill form taken daily for a month. The purpose of this is to make sure the new drugs are efficient and well tolerated. If there are no problems, your doctor will then proceed to the next phase which involves intramuscular injections of Cabenuva and stopping the oral form.
 
If no:

M: You can ask me at any time about how Cabenuva works. I’m here to help. 


Side effects

P: What are side effects of Cabenuva? 
M: Since Cabenuva is administered with two deep muscular injections, most patients experience discomfort, pain, redness and swelling from the injection site for a few days.
M: Some patients also have headaches, unusual tiredness and nausea.
 

How much does Cabenuva cost? 

M: Cabenuva is covered by most insurance plans. For Quebec, it is covered by RAMQ, which means that all insurance must also cover it. Therefore your copay should remain the same as it was with your previous treatment.
 
Lenacapavir

P: What is Lenacapavir?
M: Lenacapvir is the first Capsid Inhibitor approved recently in Canada(2022),  for use in HIV treatment. 
M: When Lenacapavir is used with other HIV drugs, it can help suppress the production of new copies of HIV.
M: Lenacapavir is available in two formulations, a pill for oral use and a liquid formulation for injection just under the skin(subcutaneous injection).
M: Would you like to know more about how to take the medicine?

IF Y:
M: When initiating treatment with Lenacapavir, the pill formulation is taken on days one,two and eight, after which no further oral doses are needed. 
M: On day 15 of the initiation periods, a healthcare provider injects two doses of Lenacapavir into the belly. Subsequent injections are then needed every six months to maintain effective levels of Lenacapavir in the blood. 
M: For now, Lenacapavir needs to be taken with oral formulations of other HIV treatments, as this drug on its own is not sufficient to treat HIV. 

IF N:
M: Great! If you have more questions about how to take the medicine, check with your Healthcare Provider for more information. 

P: Who is Lenacapavir meant for? Who is Lenacapavir for?

M: Lenacapavir is approved for use by adults who have HIV-1 that is resistant to many other treatments and whose current regimen is failing due to drug resistance or intolerance

P: What are the side effects of Lenacapavir?

M: Side effects reported in studies include nausea, diarrhea, and headache. These side effects were generally mild or moderate and temporary.
M: Skin reactions at the point of injection such as swelling and itching are common with Lenacapavir but most are mild and temporary.


P: Are there any drugs I shouldn’t eat with Lenacapavir?

M: Yes. People taking Lenacapavir should not take the following drugs: antiseizure drugs(carbamazepine, phenytoin), antibiotics(rifampin, rifapentine), herbs(St.John’s wort and its extract). 
M: There are other drug interactions that can occur when taking Lenacapavir, so discuss with pharmacist prior to starting a new medicine or changing a drug regimen.

M: You can also ask me to help you set a reminder for taking your medications by saying” add a reminder”.







Drug resistance and resistance testing 
 
Définition:
P: What is drug resistance?
 
M: Drug resistance means that the virus in your body is resistant to a certain medication. In other words, the drug you’re taking in no longer capable of stopping the virus from multiplying in your body.
M: It happens when the HIV changes form and become unrecognizable to the drug that was previously effective. 
 
Causes 
P: What causes drug resistance?
P: How does someone become drug resistant?
P: Why is my body drug-resistant?
 
M: A drug resistant virus can be acquired directly through transmission from a person to person at the time of infection.
 
M: Drug resistance can also be developed if the person misses many doses. This allows the virus to multiply and increases the risk that the virus changes form and become drug resistant.
M: It can develop on its own after many years of treatment.
 
 
 
Prévention:
P: How can I prevent drug resistance?
P: How can I reduce the risk of drug resistance?
 
M: If you’re under treatment, take the medication as prescribed,
M: Do not interrupt your treatment. Skipping doses of HIV medicines allows HIV to multiply and increases the risk that the virus changes form and become drug resistant.
M:  Remembering to take medication regularly and consistently could be challenging. Do you want to view some useful adherence tips?
 
If Yes:
M: 3.1.7 Tips for medication adherence
 
If No
M: You can ask me at any time. I’ll be glad to help.
M: You can also ask me to help you set a reminder for taking your medications by saying” add a reminder”.
 
 
M: Are you experiencing side effects from your medicine now?
 
If YES
M: Let your health care professional know as soon as you can. He/she can help you manage the situation and not interrupt the treatment.
 
 
If NO
M: Great.
M: Always let your health care professional know if you have new or unusual symptoms or side effects, he/she can help you manage the situation and not interrupt the treatment.
 
 
 
Test de résistance
P: When should I get a resistance test?
P: Why should I get a resistance test?
P: Is a resistance test important?
P: How do you test for drug resistance?
 
 
M: Resistance testing is done using a blood sample. It is usually done at the beginning of a treatment, before you restart or before you change a treatment or in case of a treatment failure.   
M: It identifies medications that won’t be effective against HIV in your body. It is done to guide the selection of your treatment.
 
 
 
P: Am I drug resistant?
P: How do I know if I’m drug resistant?
P: Who can tell me if I have a resistance to a certain drug?
P: What are the signs of drug resistance?
 
M: If your viral load does not go down as expected or if you stay detectable, a resistance test is done to show whether the virus in your body has changed and developed resistance to the drugs you’re taking.
M: Resistance tests identify medications that won’t be effective against HIV in your body. It is done to guide the selection of your treatment.
 
Conséquences:
 
P: What are the consequences of drug resistance?
P: How does resistance affect my health?
P: What are the effects of drug resistance
 
M:  Drug resistance can cause HIV treatment to fail.
M: If the tests show that you have a drug-resistant virus, your health care provider will change the treatment and give you a new combination of drugs that are efficient.  
M: Keep in mind that a virus can continue to build resistance upon resistance and there will be fewer treatment options remain efficient.
M: You’ll be less able to achieve viral suppression even with complete adherence
 
 
P: Can you reverse drug resistance?
P: How do you get rid of drug resistance?
P: Can you recover from drug resistance?
 
M: Once you have a drug resistant virus, you will always have it.
M: Keep in mind that a virus can continue to build resistance upon resistance. That’s why prevention is key.
M: There are many things you can do to prevent drug resistance. (Prévention)

 STIs
13. 1 Definition
P: Do you have information on STIs? 
M: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are passed on and contracted through close contact with infected skin or mucosa (kissing, vaginal, anal or oral sex). STIs can be divided into bacterial (bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, Mycoplasma genitalium, lymphogranuloma venereum, pelvic inflammatory disease, syphilis, chancroid), viral (HIV, HPV, genital herpes and hepatitis B) and parasitic ones (trichomoniasis, pubic lice, scabies).

13. 2 Presentation
P: How do STIs present?
M: STIs do not always present with symptoms, therefore, prevention and testing are key measures to reduce the risks of acquiring and transmitting STIs. 
M: Symptoms can include vaginal, penile or anal discharge, painful urination, sore throat, sores that can result in pain, itch or no symptoms, muscle, abdominal or testicular pain, painful intercourse, enlarged lymph nodes, vaginal or rectal bleeding, change in the color of the urine, stool, skin or eyes and non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, headache, nausea, decreased appetite and fever.
https://www.catie.ca/essentials/sti-basics
13.3 Diagnosis
P: How are STIs diagnosed?
M: The diagnosis of STIs include a physical examination (this can include an external exam, speculum and bimanual exam and/or a PAP test for HPV) and laboratory tests. 
M: Chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis are diagnosed with a urine test. 
M: HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are diagnosed with a blood test. 
M: Also, throat, vaginal, penile or anal swabs may be collected to test for chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, herpes or syphilis (the last two are tested for if symptoms are present). 
https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/sexual-health/getting-tested-sexually-transmitted-infections.html
13.4 Treatment
P: How are STIs treated?
M: Bacterial STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis are treated with antibiotics. Viral STIs such as HPV, genital herpes and hepatitis A and B do not have a cure, but symptoms can be managed. There is a cure for hepatitis C.
https://www.catie.ca/essentials/sti-basics
Hep B: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/reports-publications/primary-care-management-hepatitis-b-quick-reference.html#sec4
Hep C: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/hepatitis-c/health-professionals-hepatitis-c.html#a2
13.5 Prevention
P: How are STIs prevented? 
M: There are vaccines to protect yourself against HPV as well hepatitis A and B, you can talk to your healthcare provider to know more about those.
M: Using barrier protection (external or internal condoms, dental dam) during sexual intercourse is an effective measure to decrease the likelihood of contracting or transmitting an STIs. The use of a non-oil-based (water, silicone) lubricant can contribute to decreasing the risk of damaging the condom and the skin/mucosa.
M: In order to decrease the risk of transmitting an STI, getting tested is an important step. You might consider getting tested if you have symptoms, unprotected sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners and if one of your sexual partners has tested positive for an STI.
M: Other factors can also be discussed with your healthcare provider to determine if you need to get tested and/or the frequency at which you might want to get screened for STIs.

13.6.1 Monkeypox
13.1 Definition and presentation
P: What is monkeypox?

M: Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that is rarely fatal. It is not related to chickenpox. 
M: The main symptoms are fever, headache, muscle ache, swollen lymph nodes, tiredness, chills and a rash that can look like a pimple or blister. 
M: The rash can be found on the face, inside the mouth, on hands, feet, genitals and many other parts of the body.
M: You can get a rash first, then symptoms or only a rash. 
M: It usually takes 2-4 weeks to heal. 

Sources: https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/about.html

13.2 Transmission

P: How is monkeypox transmitted?

M: Monkeypox spreads from close, skin-to-skin contact. 
M: This includes direct contact with the rash, objects and surfaces touched by someone with monkeypox, sexual contact (anal, vaginal and oral sex).
M: Monkeypox also spreads through respiratory droplets, but it is not the primary mode of transmission.
M: It can also spread from an infected pregnant person to the fetus. 
M: We still don’t know if it can spread when someone has no symptoms. 

Ref: https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/about.html

13.3 Diagnosis

P: How is monkeypox diagnosed?
M: Monkeypox is diagnosed by taking a sample from a lesion or scab from the skin of the individual getting tested to analyze it for presence of the virus or its DNA. 
Ref: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/monkeypox/health-professionals.html#a5
13.4 Treatment

P: How is monkeypox treated?
M: Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, namely managing the pain and tending to the wounds, and at addressing any complications that arise such as bacterial superinfections. 
M: Antivirals originally used against smallpox could be helpful, in certain situations, but further data is needed about their effectiveness against monkeypox. 
Ref: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/monkeypox/symptoms-management.html#a4
13.5 Prevention

P: What can I do to prevent monkeypox?

M: To protect yourself from monkeypox, you should avoid close contact with people who have a rash that looks like monkeypox (do not touch the rash, do not hug, kiss or have sex with the person with monkeypox)
M: You should also avoid objects used by a person with monkeypox: do not share utensils, linens, clothing, towels, etc.
M: Wash your hands with soap and water before eating, touching your face and after using the bathroom. 
M: If you are eligible for vaccination, getting vaccinated is important to stop the spread of monkeypox. 
M: Would you like to know more about the vaccines available?

IF Y: go to vaccine scenario

14.7. 	Prevention:

P: How can I prevent opportunistic infections?

M: Taking HIV medications every day is the best way to prevent getting opportunistic infections (OIs), because they prevent HIV from damaging your immune system and keep you strong and healthy. If you develop an OI, talk to your healthcare provider about how to treat it and prevent it in the future.


Steps you can take to avoid getting OI
Talk to your doctor about medications and vaccines that prevent certain OIs.
Prevent exposure to sexually transmitted diseases.
Do not share needles, syringes or other drug injection equipment.
Limit your exposure to germs found in animal feces, saliva, or skin.
Do not eat certain foods raw, for example: eggs, milk and cheese, unpasteurized fruit juices, or raw seed sprouts.
Do not drink untreated water. Use bottled water.
Talk to your doctor about things that could expose you to OIs at work, at home, and on vacation.

17.1.2 Food safety

P: What is food safety? How to acquire food safety?
M: Food safety practices are key to preserve the quality of food as well as prevent contamination and food borne illness. 

M: 4 Basic steps to Food safety are 
1. Clean: Wash hands and surfaces
2. Separate: Avoid cross-contamination
3.Cook: Cook to safe temperature 
4. Chill: Refrigerate promptly

M: Would you like to know more about each one or specify what you are interested in?

Clean: Wash hands and surfaces
Wash your hand, surfaces of cutting boards and utensils well with warm soapy water before and after preparing foods
RInse vegetables and fruits 
Don’t wash meat, poultry, fish, or eggs, as it may spread bacteria.
Separate: Avoid cross-contamination
Place raw meats, poultry, and seafood on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to prevent dripping onto already prepared foods
Consider using one cutting board only for raw foods and another only for ready-to-eat or cooked foods.
Cook: Cook to safe temperature
Use thermometer to check the temperatures of meats
You can look at the recommended safe minimum internal temperatures chart.
Chill: Refrigerate promptly
Maintaining a constant refrigerator temperature of 40°F or below as cold temperatures slow the growth of harmful bacteria, reducing the risk of foodborne illness
You can look at the cold storage chart for guidance

P: Why is food safety important? Why is it necessary for me to adhere to food safety practices?

M: As people living with HIV are susceptible to many types of infection, there is more likelihood of a lengthier period, undergo hospitalization or severe outcome if you contract a foodborne illness. Therefore, you must be more cautious when handling, preparing, and consuming foods to minimize the risks.

M:Would you like to know more about foodborne illness symptoms?

P: What are the symptoms of foodborne illness?

M: Symptoms of foodborne illness are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, or abdominal cramps. If you develop these symptoms or suspect you may have food poisoning, contact your healthcare provider immediately.

P: Can I have raw eggs, raw meat, raw beef, tartare, raw seafood, raw fish, sushi, sashimi, raw oyster, raw shellfish?
M: Avoid eating raw eggs, meats, or seafood (including sushi and shellfish). Use only boiled water or certified filtered water for drinking and cooking.

P: Can I have xxxxx?
M: Sorry,I still don't have the answer to this question since I am still in training. You can try checking these resources instead Eating Tips: A Nutrition Guide for People Living with HIV/AIDS (ny.gov) or Food Safety for People with HIV/AIDS (ucdavis.edu)


Stay active
P:How much exercise do I need?

M: Recommendations call for at least 150 minutes (2½ hours) of moderate-intensity exercise each week to elevate your heart rate. This can be broken up into shorter segments as needed, such as at least 30 minutes, 5 times a week. Additionally, everyday activities like household chores also contribute to achieving the goal of 30 minutes a day.

M:However, don't overdo it. If you try to exercise too hard, too long, or in ways you aren’t used to without rest, it can have adverse effects. The best way to start a new routine is slowly. Work your way up, little by little!

M: Choose activities that you enjoy and try to include all three types of exercise in your program: stretching, anaerobic, and aerobic.Would you like to know more about each one? Or you can specify one that you are interested in!

18. Stages of HIV

18.1. P: What are the different stages of HIV

M: There 3 stages of HIV
Acute HIV infection
Chronic or Latent HIV infection
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
With antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment, it can slow or prevent HIV from advancing to later stages and help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives

M: Would you like to know more about each one? Or you can specify one that you are interested in!

P: Yes! If 1/2/3:
Stage 1: Acute HIV infection is the earliest stage of HIV infection, generally developing within 2 to 4 weeks after contracting HIV. During this time, some people experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, and rash. HIV is highly infectious during the acute stage because the virus multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body. It attacks and destroys CD4 cells, which are infection-fighting white blood cells that help coordinate the immune response. This rapid increase in HIV viral load can be detected before HIV antibodies are present. Starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) during this stage can provide significant health benefits.

Stage 2: Chronic HIV infection, also called asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency, is the stage of HIV infection between acute HIV infection and the onset of AIDS. During this stage, HIV gradually increases and continues to multiply in the body but at very low levels. The number of CD4 cells decreases indicating increasing damage to the immune system. People with chronic HIV infection may not have any HIV-related symptoms. 

Without ART, chronic HIV infection usually advances to AIDS in 10 years or longer, though in some people it may advance faster. People who are taking ART may be in this stage for several decades. While it is still possible to transmit HIV to others during this stage, people who take ART exactly as prescribed and maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex.

Stage 3: AIDS is the final, most severe stage of HIV infection. Since HIV significantly damages the immune system, the body becomes vulnerable to life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers, those that occur more frequently or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems. People with HIV are diagnosed with AIDS if their CD4 count is less than 200 cells/mm3 or if they have certain opportunistic infections. Once diagnosed with AIDS, individuals can have a high viral load and can transmit HIV to others very easily. Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years.

Ref: The Stages of HIV Infection | NIH (Provided in collaboration with NIH’s Office of AIDS Research)

18.2. P: Does getting diagnosed with HIV mean I have AIDS?

M: Not necessarily, AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the virus severely damages the body’s immune system. A person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when the CD4 cell count falls below 200 cells/mm3 or when developing opportunistic infections, regardless of the CD4 count.

Cardiovascular diseases
M: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels.

M: There's strong evidence that HIV infection can lead to heart attack, stroke, and heart failure, especially if untreated.
M: The replication of HIV triggers inflammation and accelerates the aging of blood vessels.
M: Plus, High levels of certain fats in the blood, like triglycerides and  'bad' cholesterol (known as LDL-C) and low levels of 'good' cholesterol ( known as HDL- C), can add to these risks. Some HIV medications can also raise blood lipid levels. All these factors cause plaque buildup in blood vessel walls, which affects blood flow to the heart
M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause.

M: The first and most important step is to quit smoking, improve diet, exercise routine, and control weight. 

M: Medications such as beta blockers, angiotensin-inhibiting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), or calcium channel blockers may be prescribed. In some cases, surgery options like angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy, or bypass surgery are performed

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.
Cardiac Arrhythmia (Irregular heartbeat)
M: Cardiac arrhythmias is a c condition characterized by irregular heartbeats, such as ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and long QT syndrome (known as Torsades de pointes).
M: These arrhythmias can precede sudden cardiac death, which is a major cause of mortality in people living with HIV
M: It may occur due to structural abnormalities, reduced heart rate variability (a sign of autonomic dysfunction), and a high HIV viral load. 

M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause.

Anemia



M: Anemia is a condition that occurs when there are not enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body.
M: One of the primary causes of anemia is blood loss, often linked to frequent opportunistic infections. Besides, It may involve the direct effects of the virus, which impair the precursor of the red blood cells (erythropoietin) 

M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause.

Ref: Anemia in HIV Infection: Clinical Impact and Evidence-Based Management Strategies | Clinical Infectious Diseases | Oxford Academic (oup.com)


M: The symptoms may include fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion which result from less oxygen delivery to tissue, 


M: Additionally, in order to compensate for the lack of oxygen, the body responds with rapid breathing and fast resting heart rate.


M: However, the severity and speed at which anemia develops determine the intensity of these symptoms.


M: The treatment guideline includes HAART and epoetin alfa (erythropoietin injection)

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.


Immune Thrombocytopenia



M: Immune Thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disease characterized by a low platelet count, cells that help the blood to clot.
M: It is likely caused when HIV infects the cells in the bone marrow that produce platelets or confuses the immune system into attacking platelets in the circulation. 
M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 
Ref: Risk factors for ganciclovir-induced thrombocytopenia and leukopenia - PubMed (nih.gov) (2015)


M: The symptoms may include bruising very easily or, in serious cases, develop uncontrollable bleeding, which may manifest as petechiae, ecchymosis, nosebleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding, oral mucosal bleeding, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

M:Note that these symptoms can vary from person to person.
M: The treatment guideline includes anti-HIV drugs, Corticosteroid and Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.
Neutropenia
M: Neutropenia is when there's a decrease in a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, which fight bacteria and fungi.


M: During HIV infection, neutropenia can have multiple causes, such as the direct effects of HIV, or as complication of secondary infections and malignancy, 
M: There is also research linking neutropenia to the side effects of certain HIV drugs like zidovudine, anti-cytomegalovirus drugs like ganciclovir, and medications used in cancer treatment.
M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 


Ref: Neutropenia during HIV Infection: Adverse Consequences and Remedies - PMC (nih.gov) (2014)


M: Neutropenia itself does not cause any symptoms. However, people who have neutropenia are at increased risk from these infections.


M: The treatment guideline includes antibiotics and G-CSF (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor), a drug stimulating white blood cells production

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.

Ref: neutropenia_pg1_v3.pdf (uhbristol.nhs.uk)
Thromboembolic disease
M: Thromboembolic disease is a condition in which a blood clot forms and dislodges to travel through the bloodstream as an embolus.


M: Thromboembolic disease can be caused by lower levels of substances that help prevent excessive blood clotting (antithrombin and anticoagulants), along with conditions like cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune disorders. 

M: Additionally, damage to blood vessels from injecting drugs, vascular catheters, and CMV infection can contribute to this condition

M:Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 


M: Virchow’s triad refers to the three major factors for developing venous thrombosis:

M: There are several types of thromboembolic disease, each with distinct symptoms that may vary depending on the affected vessels. Sometimes, it does not cause symptoms until serious complications develop.

M: For example,
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Swollen and tender legs that are painful to the touch
2. Pulmonary embolism: Shortness of breath and pain when breathing
3. Brachial artery thrombosis: Pain while walking (Intermittent claudication), weakness, numbness, muscle cramping due to decreased arterial flow.

Joint pain ( Arthralgia)


M:Joint pain (Arthralgia) is the most common but non-specific articular complaint of HIV-positive patients. It tends to occur in the acute phase of the infection.The frequently affected joints are the knees, shoulders and elbows.


M:It is likely to be the result of direct infection of the joint by the virus.

M:Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 

ref Human immunodeficiency virus infection and inflammatory arthritis: A review of clinical and imaging features - PMC (nih.gov) (2017)




M:The treatment guideline includes simple analgesia, such as paracetamol, or anti-inflammatories, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and rest

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.
Arthritis 
M: Arthritis refers to the inflammation of the joint. There are several types of arthritis that are commonly found in people living with HIV including 

{ 3 Buttons for 1.Reactive arthritis, 2.Rheumatoid arthritis, 
3.HIV-associated arthropathy (asymmetric oligoarthritis) }
1. M: Reactive arthritis involves joint pain and swelling that typically occur several days or weeks after an infection in another part of the body, most often in the digestive and urinary system (gastrointestinal, genitourinary tract), or as a complication of HIV-associated infections. 

M: Previously, reactive arthritis was sometimes called Reiter's syndrome with a classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis. However, the majority of patients do not present with this classic triad

M:Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 

ref: Reactive Arthritis - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov) (2013)
2.M: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory process with systemic autoimmune pathology, which means that your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. 
M: It can damage both joints and extra-articular organs, including the heart, kidney, lung, digestive system, eye, skin and nervous system 
M:Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause.

3.M:HIV-associated arthropathy is typically characterized by oligoarthritis with an asymmetric pattern affecting the knees and ankles, found more in male patients.

M: However, less commonly, HIV-related arthritis may mimic rheumatoid arthritis with a symmetrical polyarthropathy that can become destructive.

additional question

P: Then how can we distinguish between these two? How can we distinguish Rheumatoid arthritis and HIV-associated arthropathy?

M:By using serological tests, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-nuclear factor antibodies associated with inflammatory arthritides, it can be determined that these tests will be negative in HIV-associated arthropathy but positive in patients with rheumatoid arthritis

M:Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 

Ref: Human immunodeficiency virus infection and inflammatory arthritis: A review of clinical and imaging features - PMC (nih.gov) (2017)




M: The treatment guideline is rest, NSAIDs and paracetamol, though occasionally the pain is severe or persistent enough to warrant an intra-articular corticosteroid injection. 

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.
Muscle pain (Myalgia)


M: People with HIV can experience more serious muscle conditions, including muscle pain, muscle cramping and muscle disorders that result in weakness. The pain often involves the back, hips or lower limbs. 

M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause

M: There are A wide variety of pain medications such as acetaminophen, aspirin, and ibuprofen. Topical pain medicines, such as gels, creams, or patches, are also available for pain that is in a specific area.
M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.


Osteoporosis
M: Osteoporosis develops when bone mass and mineral density decrease, leading to a greater risk of broken bones or fractures. 
M: The increase in osteoporosis found in HIV-infected individuals may be due to the cytotoxic effects of the virus itself or the prolonged use of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART).

M:Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause.

Avascular necrosis of bone/ Osteonecrosis
M: Osteonecrosis is a condition characterized by bone death caused by poor blood supply. It is also known as avascular necrosis and aseptic necrosis of bone, commonly in the hip and shoulder.
M: HIV infection can increase the risk of poor blood supply that leads to bone death or osteonecrosis.

M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 
steroid use and   hyperlipidemia
ref: nihms743500.pdf (2012)
M: The symptoms may include pain in the affected joint, which may worsen over time even at rest. The pain can become severe with limited range of motion if the bone collapses or deteriorates.


M: For example, 
-Groin pain, if the hip joint is affected.
-Limping or walking difficulty, if the condition occurs in the leg.
-Difficulty with overhead movement, if the shoulder joint is affected.
ref: Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis) - Symptoms and Causes (pennmedicine.org)
M: The treatment of osteonecrosis is determined by the stage of the disease and the clinical presentation. The most common surgical procedure used for treating advanced osteonecrosis is arthroplasty, which aims to restore joint function

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN)
M: HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is the collapse of the filtering unit of the kidney, known as glomeruli, which is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

+ additional question

P: Which form of glomerulonephropathy is commonly found? /HIVAN is commonly manifest in which form?

M: It is often in the form of focal segmental  glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).



M: When the HIV virus infects renal epithelial cells, it causes abnormal proliferation and dysregulated filtration at the slit diaphragm, leading to a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and high level of protein in urine (proteinuria)
M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 

ref: HIV- Associated Nephropathy: Pathogenesis - PMC (nih.gov) (2012)
patients of African descent, low CD4 count, co-infection with hepatitis B and C, noninfectious comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), aging

ref: Kidney Disease and HIV Infection - PubMed (nih.gov)


M: The symptoms may include rapidly progressive kidney disease, significant proteinuria, hypertension, hematuria, edema, preserved or enlarged size kidney

M: Note that these symptoms can vary from person to person


M: The treatment guideline includes combined antiretroviral therapy to reduce the likelihood of progression into ESRD, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with antiproteinuric agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)

M: Supportive treatments such as dialysis and renal transplantation may be required. 

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.

ref: HIV Nephropathy - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov) (2023)


HIV-associated immune complex kidney disease (HIVICK)
M: HIV-associated immune complex kidney disease (HIVICK) occurs when immune complexes form and deposit within the kidneys. 

M: This leads to inflammation of the kidney's filtering units, known as glomeruli. (glomerulonephritis)
M: The formation of immune complexes that deposit within the kidneys is caused by abnormal immune regulation and elevated protein levels.
M: Tell your doctor if you suspect these symptoms so that a proper workup can determine the cause. 
(same as HIVAN)
M: The symptoms vary with different kidney manifestations depending on the location and extent of glomerular deposits including hematuria, hypertension, urine sediment, proteinuria, renal insufficiency
(same as HIVAN)
HIV-Associated acute kidney injury (AKI)
M: Acute kidney injury or AKI is defined as the abrupt decrease in kidney function. There are some types of acute kidney injury that are commonly found in people living with HIV.

1.HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) → HIVAN (upper row)

2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a damage to the tubule cells of kidney which may caused by inadequate blood supply, infection or toxic effect of chemicals, contrast media or medications including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), several antiretroviral medications (tenofovir and indinavir), 

3. Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) occur when microscopic blood clots form in capillaries and small arteries, leading to the destruction of red blood cells, low platelet levels, and organ damage. This can result from the direct cytotoxic effects of the HIV virus or opportunistic infections.

Thrombotic Microangiopathy | Johns Hopkins Medicine
low CD4+ cell count and high HIV viral load, older age, sepsis, hypovolemic shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure

ref: Acute Kidney Injury: A Guide to Diagnosis and Management | AAFP
M: AKI is manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output.

M: It is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes such as heart failure, cardiovascular disease, ESRD, and mortality.

M: Note that these symptoms can vary from person to person
M: The treatment guidelines vary and depend on etiological factors. They often involve fluid resuscitation, cessation of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and may require hemodialysis.

M: But it is very important to follow a prescription by a doctor tailored for each patient to ensure it is suitable and will not react with HIV treatments.
